## Comment: we have to check is x is a square matrix to can invert it
##          Then if x is a square, we invert it, using inverse(x), 
##          if not print the message"This matrix cannot be inverted

makeCacheMatrix<- function(x = matrix()){
  if (ncol(x)==nrow(x)){    ## X matrix is a square matrix
    y<-inverse(x)  
    } else {y<-x
    print("This matrix cannot be inverted")}
    print(y)
}
